# DrawingMultiplayer
Hello!

!!multiplayer is only on localhost right now!!

To use this application you simply need to launch it.
in order to play singleplayer you just press the singleplayer button.
right now the saving functionailty is not implemeted, so no files will come up in that giant blank box. 

just press New Singleplayer game and the canvas should appear.

in order to play multiplayer you will have to go to the main menu, and press Multiplayer

just like before the saving functionality is currently not implemented, therefore just start the game. 
in order to join that game, start a new instance of the app. and when your in multiplayer enter the same port number as the host, and click join game.\

you should now be able to see the same canvas and draw at the same time.
there are alot of bugs right now. so yea... Have fun!
